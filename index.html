            <h2>What is the Course About?</h2>
            <p>The "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course explores foundational techniques for designing algorithms and analyzing their efficiency in solving computational problems. It focuses on understanding algorithmic paradigms like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods while emphasizing real-world applications.</p>

            <h2>What Data Structures and Algorithms Have You Studied?</h2>
            <p>This course covers essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Algorithms like sorting (merge sort, quick sort), searching (binary search), shortest path (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskal's) are studied to enhance problem-solving skills.</p>

            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                Each team member will provide insights into the following areas, divided into logical sections and subsections as per their understanding:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</li>
                <p>Iteration is often used for tasks that require repetitive actions, such as searching for a value in a list. Recursion is useful for problems like calculating factorials or solving the Tower of Hanoi. Backtracking helps in exploring all possible configurations for problems like Sudoku or N-Queens.</p>

                <li>What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth.</li>
                <p>Space efficiency refers to minimizing memory usage, while time efficiency focuses on reducing execution time. These efficiencies are crucial for optimizing system performance. Problems are classified by their growth orders such as constant \(O(1)\), linear \(O(n)\), and exponential \(O(2^n)\).</p>

                <li>Takeaways from different design principles from Chapter 2 (can use the notes provided).</li>
                <p>Key principles include Divide and Conquer for breaking problems into smaller parts, Dynamic Programming for solving overlapping subproblems, and the Greedy method for making locally optimal choices.</p>

                <li>The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, BST, AVL, 2-3, Red-Black, Heap, Trie).</li>
                <p>Trees represent hierarchical data like file systems. BSTs ensure efficient searching, AVL and Red-Black Trees maintain balance, Heaps support priority queues, and Tries are effective for string manipulations.</p>

                <li>The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</li>
                <p>Array query algorithms like Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees provide efficient solutions for range queries and updates, critical for applications in data analysis and competitive programming.</p>

                <li>Differentiate between trees and graphs and their traversals. Discuss the applications of each.</li>
                <p>Trees are a type of graph without cycles, used for hierarchy representation. Graphs, with potential cycles, are used in routing and social networks. Traversal methods like DFS and BFS help explore these structures.</p>

                <li>Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the techniques behind each, and how they connect to the real world.</li>
                <p>Sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort organize data efficiently. Searching algorithms like Binary Search are vital for quick lookups in databases.</p>

                <li>Discuss the importance of graph algorithms concerning spanning trees and shortest paths.</li>
                <p>Graph algorithms like Kruskal's and Dijkstra's solve network optimization problems, ensuring minimal connectivity and shortest routes.</p>

                <li>Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.</li>
                <p>Brute force examines all possibilities, Divide and Conquer simplifies problems, Dynamic Programming uses past results, Greedy Algorithms focus on immediate benefits, and Backtracking systematically explores solutions.</p>
            </ul>
